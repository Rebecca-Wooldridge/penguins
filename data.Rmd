## Data

Data were collected and made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER, a member of the Long Term Ecological Research Network.

The palmerpenguins package contains two datasets. One is called `penguins`, and is a simplified version of the raw data. The second dataset is `penguins_raw`, and contains all the variables and original names as downloaded. 

Both datasets contain data for 344 penguins. There are 3 different species of penguins in this dataset (`Adelie`, `Chinstrap` and `Gentoo`), collected from 3 islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.
